# Xamarin Forms Challenges

## Task 1
On opening a page, a label appears that has the value of zero. Every second this label increments its value by 1. When you minimise the app the incrementation should stop. When you open the app again, the counter should continue from where it left off. How would you use **lifecycle events** to achieve this? Please provide an explanation and the method name(s).

## Task 2
Describe how you would create a ListView that toggles its displayed text in a cell based on a boolean value in that cell. You may provide pseudo-code if it&#39;s easier to explain.

## Task 3
How you would remove the underline displayed on an Android device using the default Xamarin Entry control?
