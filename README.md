# 48Software Coding Challenge
Congratulations on making it through the first round interview!

We do not believe board questions are the best way to assess your technical capabilities. As such, we have prepared some code challenges for you to complete and bring with you to the technical discussion. We value discussion around code more than we value the ability to complete an algorithm in front of an audience.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to raise them with us. Please note down any assumptions you may make during the challenges. Feel free to add unit tests or explanations of how you would test your methods.

Good luck, take your time, and have fun! ðŸ˜Š

## Back-end Code Challenges
The [BackEndChallenges.md](questions/BackEndChallenges.md) file contains the instructions for the back-end challenges that you are required to complete.

## Front-end Challenges
The [Front-end Challenges](questions/FrontEndChallenges.md) file contains the instructions for the the front-end challenges that you are required to complete.

The front-end challenges are a mixture of code and theory.

## Impress Us (optional)
Have you done any recent work on personal projects, or contributed code to any open-source project?

We would LOVE to take a look and see what you are passionate about.
